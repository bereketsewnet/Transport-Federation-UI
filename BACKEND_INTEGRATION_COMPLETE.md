5. Member sets new password + 3 security questions
6. System returns full `token` → Member can access dashboard

### **For Existing Members**:
1. Member logs in with username + password
2. System returns full `token` + user info
3. Redirects to `/member/dashboard`

### **Forgot Password Flow**:
1. Member clicks "Forgot Password" on login page
2. Enters username → Receives 3 security questions
3. Answers all 3 questions correctly
4. Sets new password
5. Can now login with new password

### **Admin Password Reset**:
1. Admin resets member password via API
