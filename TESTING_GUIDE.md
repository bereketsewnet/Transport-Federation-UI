## 🧪 **Testing Steps:**

### **Step 1: Test White Pages Fix**
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/admin/executives`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/admin/cbas`
3. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/admin/terminated-unions`
4. **Expected**: Pages should load properly (no more white pages)

### **Step 2: Test Debug Logging**
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/admin/unions/new`
2. Fill out the form with test data
3. Click "Create Union"
4. **Check Browser Console** for debug logs:
   - `👀 Form values:` - Shows current form values
   - `❌ Form errors:` - Shows validation errors
   - `🔍 Form submission started` - Shows form submission
   - `📝 Form data:` - Shows data being submitted
   - `📤 Sending data to API:` - Shows data sent to API

### **Step 3: Test Simple Form**
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/admin/test-form`
2. Fill out the simple test form
3. Click "Submit Test Form"
4. **Check Browser Console** for debug logs
5. **Expected**: Should show form data and success message

## 🔍 **What to Look For:**

### **In Browser Console:**
- Form values being tracked correctly
- Validation errors (if any)
- API request data
- API response or errors

### **In Network Tab:**
- API requests being made
- Request payload
- Response status and data
- Any 400/500 errors

### **In Form Behavior:**
- Fields showing validation errors
- Form submission being blocked
- Success/error messages

---

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

### **If Forms Work:**
- Console shows form data
- API requests are made
- Success navigation occurs

### **If Forms Don't Work:**
- Console shows validation errors
- API requests fail
- Error messages appear

## 🚨 **Common Issues to Check:**

### **1. Form Validation Issues:**
- Fields not properly registered
- yup schema validation failing
- Form state not updating

### **2. API Issues:**
- Wrong API endpoint
- Incorrect data format
- Authentication problems
- Backend validation failing

### **3. Component Issues:**

## 🛠️ **Next Steps Based on Results:**

### **If Test Form Works:**
- Issue is with specific forms (Unions, News, etc.)
- Check form-specific validation schemas
- Check form-specific API endpoints

### **If Test Form Doesn't Work:**
- Issue is with basic form setup
- Check react-hook-form configuration

- Check request format
- Check backend status
- Check authentication
