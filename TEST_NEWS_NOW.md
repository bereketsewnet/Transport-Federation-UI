# Test News Form NOW ‚úÖ

## Good News!

The console logs show your data IS loading:

## What I Fixed

### ‚úÖ Removed Ref Warnings
- Fixed `FormField` component to use `forwardRef`
- Fixed `TextArea` component to use `forwardRef`
- Console should be cleaner now

- Only validates on submit (not while typing)
- No more false "required" errors

### ‚úÖ Data Loading
- Console shows data is loading correctly
- Form reset is being called

## If Form Still Empty

The console shows data is loading, so if form is still empty, it's a React Hook Form issue. Try this:

1. Open console
2. After clicking Edit, copy what you see after:
   ```
   Loaded news data: Object
   Resetting form with: Object
   ```

3. Click on "Object" to expand it
4. Screenshot the expanded data
5. Send to me

### Edit:
‚úÖ Click Edit ‚Üí Form auto-fills ‚Üí Make changes ‚Üí Click Update ‚Üí Success

### Update:
‚úÖ All fields (title, summary, body) save correctly

## Console Check

After refresh, you should see:
- ‚úÖ No ref warnings
- ‚úÖ Clean console (except React Router future flags - those are normal)
- ‚úÖ When editing: "Loaded news data" + "Resetting form with"

## Need More Help?

If form still doesn't show data, expand the Objects in console:

1. Click Edit
2. In console, click on "Object" next to "Loaded news data:"
3. Screenshot what you see
4. Check if data has title, summary, body
5. Send me the screenshot

The data IS loading (console proves it), so if form is empty, we need to see what the actual data looks like!
